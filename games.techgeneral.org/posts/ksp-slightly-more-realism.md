# Core set

Pretty much everyone should use these all the time.

* KerbalEngineerRedux - Why would you ever not want this?
* DockingPortAlignmentIndicator - Don’t see why I can’t have useful obvious
  technology on my space ship
* KerbalAlarmClock - Prevent slips of hands from missing markers, and slips of
  mind from doing what I want to do.

# Realism-ish

* RemoteTech - Have a few reasons to set up a communications network.
* TACLS - Have a few reasons to set up space stations and planetary bases
* KAS/KIS - Connect up things after the fact.  Make bigger things.  Have a
  reason to EVA.

# Trying out

* FinalFrontier - I like the idea of building a story around what each Kerbal
  has done.  This is a start.
* kOS - I love the idea of programmed unmanned probes that maybe get updated
  programs every once in a while.  Also a less cheaty way of auto-launching,
  perhaps?
* InfernalRobotics - I love the idea, but I’ve been let done by the bugginess
  of this too many times.  Giving it another try.

# Twilight

* MechJeb2 - I’m using this less and less.
